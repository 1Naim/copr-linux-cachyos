Akmods startup script will rebuild akmod packages during system
boot, while its background daemon will build them for kernels right
after they were installed.

The akmods systemd service provides both, and is enabled by default.

The akmods-shutdown service is disabled by default but can, in some
circumstances, provide an additional chance to build and install a kernel
module. Users who would prefer longer shutdowns over delayed startups
may wish to consider enabling it with the following command:

    sudo systemctl enable --now akmods-shutdown.service
